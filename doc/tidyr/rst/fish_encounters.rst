Fish encounters
---------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Information about fish swimming down a river: each station represents an
autonomous monitor that records if a tagged fish was seen at that
location. Fish travel in one direction (migrating downstream).
Information about misses is just as important as hits, but is not
directly recorded in this form of the data.

Usage

   fish_encounters

Format
~~~~~~
